  interacting with and monitoring the multi-agent system.


> think hard and continue


‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The user wants me to "think hard and continue" with the work. Looking at the todo list, I just completed the multi-agent system implementation
  and marked it as completed. The next task in progress is "Create ADK Web Interface configuration for debugging" which is marked as "in_progress".

  Let me think about what this involves:

  1. ADK (Google Agent Development Kit) has a web interface capability for debugging
  2. This would involve configuring the web interface to work with our multi-agent research platform
  3. The interface should allow debugging, monitoring, and interaction with the agents
  4. It should integrate with our existing architecture (logging, services, agents, etc.)

  Looking at the CLAUDE.md file, I can see there are references to ADK web interface:
  - "adk web --port 8081" for running locally
  - The main.py uses get_fast_api_app() from ADK

  So I need to:
  1. Create proper ADK web interface configuration
  2. Set up debugging capabilities
  3. Create monitoring dashboards
  4. Integrate with our multi-agent system
  5. Provide agent interaction capabilities
  6. Set up proper routing and API endpoints

  Let me think about the structure:
  - Web interface configuration files
  - Debug monitoring setup
  - Agent interaction endpoints
  - Real-time monitoring
  - Performance dashboards
  - Agent registry visualization
  - Task orchestration monitoring

  I should create:
  1. ADK web interface configuration
  2. Debug monitoring system
  3. Agent interaction interface
  4. Real-time dashboards
  5. API endpoints for monitoring
  6. Integration with existing services

  Let me start implementing this systematically.


‚óè Continuing with the ADK Web Interface configuration for debugging. Let me implement a comprehensive debugging and monitoring interface that
  integrates with our multi-agent system.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The user wants me to continue implementing the ADK Web Interface configuration for debugging. I need to think about what components are most
  critical for a comprehensive debugging and monitoring interface for the multi-agent system.

  Looking at the current todo list, I need to implement:
  - ADK Web Interface configuration for debugging (in_progress)

  Based on the multi-agent system I just implemented, the web interface should provide:

  1. Core Web Interface - Main interface class that integrates with ADK
  2. Configuration - Web configuration for debugging and monitoring
  3. API Endpoints - REST APIs for agent management, orchestration, debugging
  4. Real-time Dashboards - Agent status, task monitoring, performance metrics
  5. WebSocket Handlers - Real-time updates and live debugging
  6. Debug Interface - Step-through debugging, agent inspection, log viewing
  7. Monitoring Interface - Performance monitoring, metrics collection
  8. Event Handlers - Event-driven updates and notifications

  Based on the context summary provided and the current todo list, I can see I was working on "Create ADK Web Interface configuration for
  debugging" which is currently marked as "in_progress".

  Looking at the files I just read, I can see that the web interface implementation is quite comprehensive:

  1. /src/web/dashboards.py - Dashboard components for monitoring agents, tasks, and performance with real-time updates
  2. /src/web/handlers.py - WebSocket and event handlers for real-time communication
  3. /src/web/api.py - REST API endpoints for agent management, orchestration, and debugging
  4. /src/web/interface.py - Core web interface with ADK FastAPI integration, debug and monitoring interfaces
  5. /src/web/config.py - Configuration classes for different environments

  The web interface implementation looks quite complete. What seems to be missing is:

  1. A main web application entry point that ties everything together
  2. HTML templates or frontend components for the dashboard UI
  3. Static assets (CSS, JavaScript) for the web interface
  4. A main runner/launcher for the web interface

  Let me create the missing components to complete the ADK Web Interface configuration for debugging task.

  I should:
  1. Create a main web application runner (/src/web/app.py or /src/web/main.py)
  2. Create basic HTML templates for the dashboards
  3. Create a web interface launcher script
  4. Update the todo to mark this task as completed and move to the next one

  Let me start with the main web application entry point.

  Perfect! I've successfully completed the "Create ADK Web Interface configuration for debugging" task. Now the next task in progress is "Develop
  Streamlit interface for production UX".

  Let me continue with this task by creating a Streamlit interface that provides a more user-friendly production interface compared to the
  debugging web interface. The Streamlit interface should be:

  1. More focused on end-user interactions
  2. Less technical/debugging-oriented
  3. Better suited for production use cases
  4. Easier to use for non-technical users

  Let me start by creating the Streamlit interface structure.

‚óè I've successfully completed the ADK Web Interface configuration for debugging! The implementation includes:

  ‚úÖ Complete Web Application (app.py) - Full lifecycle management with signal handling, service initialization, and graceful shutdown

  ‚úÖ Interactive Dashboard Templates - Responsive Bootstrap-based UI with real-time charts, WebSocket connectivity, and navigation

  ‚úÖ Template Rendering System - Jinja2-based rendering with custom filters for datetime, duration, file sizes, and agent-specific formatting

  ‚úÖ Enhanced Web Interface - Added template serving, dashboard data APIs, and monitoring endpoints

  ‚úÖ Easy Launcher Script - Command-line tool with environment selection, configuration overrides, and startup banner

  ‚úÖ Comprehensive Module Exports - Clean API with documentation and quick-start examples

  The web interface now provides:
  - üìä Real-time agent monitoring dashboards
  - üîß Interactive debugging capabilities
  - üìà Performance metrics and alerting
  - üåê WebSocket-based real-time updates
  - üîå RESTful APIs for programmatic access
  - üì± Responsive web UI with charts and visualizations

  Now I'll continue with the next task: Develop Streamlit interface for production UX. This will create a more user-friendly interface focused on
  production use cases rather than debugging.
