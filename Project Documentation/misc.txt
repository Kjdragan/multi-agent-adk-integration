 > yes, research sounds like a good example.  We also want to demonstrate the Agent Development      │
│   Kit's ability to utilize mcp servers as tools. We could combine both the built in research tools  │
│   i ADK and a supplemental research abilities through some useful mcps such as perplexity,          │
│   tavily, brave, and others you suggest.  An agent's (or llm judge) ability to pick the right mcps  │
│   or other research tools is going to be important. Dont just plan blindly.  Make sure you          │
│   understand all the amziong latest capaibilities of the ADK framework. Documentation is here       │
│   https://google.github.io/adk-docs/ or you can search with context7 mcp.  Make sure you use a      │
│   centralized configuration system, uv package manager for dependency and .venv  management.  Make  │
│   sure you use the google-genai python sdk which is the latest version for working with the         │
│   latest gemini llms. Also, you need to understansd using that by runing the gemini models through  │
│   vertexai wiht the latest models.  Im going to attach some AI Framework context files here you     │
│   can READ and get familiar with as these frameworks cahange quickly and you need to underrstand    │
│   using the latest versions described here.
